    "Q1 : Explain Class and Object with respect to Object-Oriented Programming. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. A class defines a set of attributes (data) and methods (functions) that all objects created from that class will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object is an instance of a class. It is a concrete entity that has specific values for the attributes defined by its class and can perform operations defined by its class's methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a class called \"Car.\" This class could have attributes such as \"color,\" \"make,\" \"model,\" and \"year.\" It could also have methods such as \"start,\" \"accelerate,\" and \"stop.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create objects (instances) of this class, such as a \"red Toyota Corolla 2022\" or a \"blue Honda Civic 2018.\" Each of these objects would have its own values for the attributes defined by the \"Car\" class and can perform operations defined by the \"Car\" class's methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In code, a class in Python would look like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, make, model, year):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        self.make = make\n",
    "        self.model = model\n",
    "        self.year = year\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def start(self):\n",
    "        print(\"The car has started.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def accelerate(self):\n",
    "        print(\"The car is accelerating.\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def stop(self):\n",
    "        print(\"The car has stopped.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can create an object of this class like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_car = Car(\"red\", \"Toyota\", \"Corolla\", 2022)\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now my_car is an object (instance) of the Car class with specific values for its attributes. We can call methods on this object like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_car.start() # Output: \"The car has started.\"\n",
    "my_car.accelerate() # Output: \"The car is accelerating.\"\n",
    "my_car.stop() # Output: \"The car has stopped.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each of these method calls performs a specific operation defined by the Car class's methods."

    "Q3 Explain why the __init__() function is used. Give a suitable example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "the __init__() function (also known as a constructor) is used to initialize an object's attributes when it is created. It is automatically called when an object of a class is created.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __init__() function is useful because it allows us to set the initial state of an object when it is created. We can use it to define the attributes of the object and their initial values. This makes it easier to create new objects of the same class because we can simply pass in the required attributes as arguments to the constructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's consider a class called \"Person\" that has two attributes, \"name\" and \"age\". We can define the __init__() function for this class to initialize these attributes when a new object is created:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Person:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, name, age):\n",
    "        self.name = name\n",
    "        self.age = age\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, the __init__() function takes two arguments, \"name\" and \"age\". These arguments are used to initialize the attributes of the object, \"self.name\" and \"self.age\".\n",
    "\n",
    "We can create a new object of this class by calling the constructor and passing in the required arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "person1 = Person(\"Vishal\", 20)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, person1 is an object of the Person class with a name of \"Vishal\" and an age of 20. We can access the object's attributes using dot notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(person1.name) \n",
    "print(person1.age)\n",
    "\n",
    "# output : \n",
    "# Vishal\n",
    "# 20\n",

    "Q4 Why self is used in OOPs?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), the self keyword is used to refer to the object that a method is being called on. \n",
    "\n",
    "When a method is called on an object, the object is automatically passed to the method as the first argument, which is typically named self. By convention, this argument is named self in Python, but it could be named anything else in other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of self is to allow methods to access the attributes and methods of the object that they are called on. It allows objects to have their own state and behavior, which can be different from other objects of the same class."

    "Q5 What is inheritance? Give an example for each type of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a key feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a new class to be created based on an existing class, inheriting the properties (attributes and methods) of the existing class. This enables reusability and reduces code duplication by allowing new classes to be built upon existing ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are five types of inheritance in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Single Inheritance:\n",
    "    Single inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a class inherits from only one parent class. It allows a subclass to inherit the attributes and methods of its parent class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, Dog is a subclass of Animal, and inherits its __init__ method and make_sound method. However, Dog overrides make_sound to make a specific sound for dogs.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    class Animal:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, name, species):\n",
    "            self.name = name\n",
    "            self.species = species\n",
    "        \n",
    "        def make_sound(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Generic animal sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "        def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "            super().__init__(name, species=\"Dog\")\n",
    "            self.breed = breed\n",
    "\n",
    "        def make_sound(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Multiple Inheritance:\n",
    "    Multiple inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a class inherits from two or more parent classes. It allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from multiple parent classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this example, Duck inherits from both CanFly and CanSwim, and can use both fly and swim methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    class CanFly:\n",
    "        def fly(self):\n",
    "            print(\"I'm flying!\")\n",
    "            \n",
    "    class CanSwim:\n",
    "        def swim(self):\n",
    "            print(\"I'm swimming!\")\n",
    "            \n",
    "    class Duck(CanFly, CanSwim):\n",
    "        def quack(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Quack!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Multilevel Inheritance:\n",
    "    Multilevel inheritance is a type of inheritance in which a subclass inherits from a parent class, which in turn inherits from another parent class. It allows a subclass to inherit attributes and methods from multiple levels of the class hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this example, Dog inherits from Mammal, which in turn inherits from Animal. Therefore, Dog has access to both make_sound and give_birth methods\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    class Animal:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, name, species):\n",
    "            self.name = name\n",
    "            self.species = species\n",
    "        \n",
    "        def make_sound(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Generic animal sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Mammal(Animal):\n",
    "        def give_birth(self):\n",
    "            print(\"I'm giving birth\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Dog(Mammal):\n",
    "        def __init__(self, name, breed):\n",
    "            super().__init__(name, species=\"Dog\")\n",
    "            self.breed = breed\n",
    "\n",
    "        def make_sound(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Woof!\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hierarchical Inheritance:\n",
    "    Hierarchical inheritance is a type of inheritance in which two or more subclasses inherit from a single parent class. It allows a parent class to be specialized into multiple subclasses, each with its own unique attributes and methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    In this example, both Circle and Square inherit from Shape, but do not inherit from each other. This is an example of hierarchical inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    class Shape:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, color):\n",
    "            self.color = color\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Circle(Shape):\n",
    "        def __init__(self, color, radius):\n",
    "            super().__init__(color)\n",
    "            self.radius = radius\n",
    "\n",
    "    class Square(Shape):\n",
    "        def __init__(self, color, side_length):\n",
    "            super().__init__(color)\n",
    "            self.side_length = side_length\n",
    "```\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Hybrid Inheritance:\n",
    "    Hybrid inheritance is a type of inheritance that combines multiple types of inheritance, such as multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance. It allows a subclass to inherit from multiple parent classes, some of which may themselves be inherited from other classes.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    In this example, Bat inherits from both Animal and CanFly, which is an example of hybrid inheritance. Bat can use the make_sound method from Animal and the fly method from CanFly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    class Animal:\n",
    "        def __init__(self, name, species):\n",
    "            self.name = name\n",
    "            self.species = species\n",
    "        \n",
    "        def make_sound(self):\n",
    "            print(\"Generic animal sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "    class CanFly:\n",
    "        def fly(self):\n",
    "            print(\"I'm flying!\")\n",
    "            \n",
    "    class Bat(Animal, CanFly):\n",
    "        def __init__(self, name):\n",
    "            super().__init__(name, species=\"Bat\")\n",
    "\n",
    "        def make_sound(self):\n",
